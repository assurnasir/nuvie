bit 0 : Warm. This tile is visible in the dark with infravision spell. LOS rules
        still apply though.
bit 1 : Support. Objects can be placed on top of this tile. Tables have 
        this bit set. 
bit 2 : Breakthrough. force passable. If an object tile has this bit set the
        underlying maptile is forced passable.
bit 3 : Ge  ??? further research needed.
bit 4 : Ignore. used on shadows etc.
bit 5 : Background. Used on solid tiles like Walkway, drawbridge etc. 
	Original acts funky if set on a (partly) transparant tile,
	e.g. the gargoyle heatsource, as the buffers aren't being cleared.
	This gives an insight into the workings of the original.
bit 6 : - article "", "a", "an", "the"

= Flag meanings =

Our best guess at the meaning of the tile flags is in the table below. Our own
names usually predate the information we got from the AceArticle's screenshots
of the original editor, the article text and the 'old docs' someone posted on
our phorum.

	*Flag*	*Size*	*Description*									*U6 editor abbr. & (guessed) name*	
						
	N	1 bit	<|4> Directional Flags. Also doubles as 4 bit impedance.			N	North	
	E	1 bit											E	East	
	S	1 bit											S	South	
	W	1 bit											W	West	
	D	1 bit	Tile does damage when stepped on						Damag	Damaging	
	M	1 bit	Tile is a wall									Wall	Wall	
	B	1 bit	Tile is blocking/impassible							Impass	Impassable	
	w	1 bit	Water for boat travel								Wet	Wet	
						
	h	1 bit	<|2>Double: this object is drawn with two tiles (x and x-1).			Double	Double width	
	v	1 bit	Double tiles can be ''not double'', ''horizontal'', ''vertical'', or ''both''	Double	Double width	
	A	1 bit	Air travel (balloon) boundary? Missile boundary					Nos	No shoot through	
	t	1 bit	toptile										For	Foreground	
	l	1 bit	LOS look through boundary, cannot be seen through unless standing next to it.	Win	Window	
	b	1 bit	LOS boundary									Opa	Opaque	
	L	2 bit	Light level (0-3)								Light	Light	
						
	Ar	2 bit	article to use for this tile							x a an the	
	3	1 bit	Background? Only on a few tiles, like floor, carpet, walkway, drawbridge	Ba 	Background 	
	2	1 bit	Ignore when looking? Only on a few tiles like shadow, egg, blood, a 'nothing'	Ig 	Ignore 	
	1	1 bit	'Ge'?, set on spinning wheel (among lots of others), see ACE mag. screenshot	Ge	?	
	f	1 bit	force passable map location							Br	Breakthrough	
	o	1 bit	can place something On-Top							Su	Supporting	
	!	1 bit	maybe meant for an infravision spell, or the peer effect?			Wa	Warm	
						

The flags in the 3rd block still to be matched more definately with our own
research. The order below is from the way they are in the screenshots in the
ACE magazine article, and seems to match with our own partial results; there's
just the little/big (or big/little) endian issue.

	*Flag*	*Size*	*Guesses at meaning*								*Our flag*	*Notes*	
	Wa	1 bit	Warm (contrasting with Wet), Warning						!		pretty sure about this one, it is set on warm-bodied creatures, some lava tiles etc.	
	Su	1 bit	Supporting; Set Upon								o		pretty sure about this one, tables, book stand, etc.	
	Br	1 bit	Breakthrough;Block(ing)/Barrier Remover;Breakable				f		pretty sure about this one, just misnamed by us	
	Ge	1 bit	?										1		0x08 (Set on the spinningwheel, so can match with this bit position)	
	Ig	1 bit	Ignore										2		0x10	
	Ba	1 bit	Background (contrasting with Foreground)					3		0x20	
	  	2 bit	Article	Ar									0xC0 known good match
